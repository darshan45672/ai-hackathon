## API Endpoints

### Backend Integration
- `POST /applications/:id/submit` - Submit application and trigger AI review
- `GET /applications/:id/ai-review-status` - Get current review status
- `POST /applications/:id/retry-ai-review/:reviewType` - Retry specific review stage (admin only)

### AI Service Direct Access
- `POST /ai-review/process/:applicationId` - Manually trigger review process
- `GET /ai-review/status/:applicationId` - Get detailed review status
- `GET /ai-review/report/:applicationId` - Get comprehensive review report
- `POST /ai-review/retry/:applicationId/:reviewType` - Retry failed review step
