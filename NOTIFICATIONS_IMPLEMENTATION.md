# Notifications Page

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive "View All Notifications" page for the hackathon application. Here's what has been created:

## üîî **Features Implemented:**

### **1. Complete Notifications Page (`/notifications`)**
- **Clean, minimalistic design** following the established design system
- **Responsive layout** that works on all devices
- **Filtering system** with tabs for All, Unread, and Read notifications
- **Pagination support** for large notification lists
- **Real-time actions** for marking as read and deleting notifications

### **2. Navigation Integration**
- Added "Notifications" item to the main navigation menu for participants
- Already connected to existing NotificationBell component that has "View All" link
- Proper role-based access (only PARTICIPANT users can access)

### **3. Notification Management Features**
- **Mark individual notifications as read**
- **Mark all notifications as read** with one click
- **Delete individual notifications**
- **View notification details** with action links
- **Real-time counts** showing total, unread, and read notifications

### **4. Smart UI Elements**
- **Notification type icons** based on notification type:
  - üìÑ Application Status Change
  - üèÜ New Application Submitted  
  - üë§ Review Assigned
  - ‚úÖ Review Completed
  - ‚öôÔ∏è System Announcement
  - ‚è∞ Deadline Reminder
- **Visual indicators** for unread notifications (blue background)
- **Relative timestamps** (e.g., "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago")
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Empty states** with helpful messaging

### **5. API Integration**
Uses existing backend notification endpoints:
- `getNotifications()` - Fetch notifications with pagination and filtering
- `markNotificationAsRead()` - Mark single notification as read
- `markAllNotificationsAsRead()` - Mark all as read
- `deleteNotification()` - Delete a notification
- `getUnreadCount()` - Get unread count for badges

## üé® **Design Philosophy:**
- **Minimalistic and clean** - focuses on content over decoration
- **Consistent with existing pages** - matches the app's design language
- **Accessible** - proper contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
- **Mobile-first** - responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- **Fast and efficient** - minimal animations, clean code

## üì± **User Experience:**
1. **Access via navigation** - Click "Notifications" in the main menu
2. **Access via notification bell** - Click "View all notifications" in the dropdown
3. **Filter notifications** - Use tabs to view All, Unread, or Read
4. **Take actions** - Mark as read, delete, or follow action links
5. **Navigate pages** - Use pagination for large notification lists

## üîß **Technical Implementation:**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React hooks** for state management
- **Next.js routing** with protected routes
- **Shadcn/ui components** for consistent styling
- **Error handling** with toast notifications
- **Loading states** for better UX

The notifications page is now fully functional and ready to use! Users can access it through the navigation menu or the notification bell dropdown, and it provides a comprehensive view of all their notifications with full management capabilities.
