# Production Readiness Checklist

## Critical Security Fixes (MUST DO)

### 1. Secrets Management
- [ ] Move all secrets to environment variables or secret management system
- [ ] Generate strong, unique passwords for all services
- [ ] Set up proper OAuth credentials with your providers
- [ ] Use HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar

### 2. TLS/HTTPS Setup
- [ ] Add SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- [ ] Configure nginx for HTTPS termination
- [ ] Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- [ ] Set up proper SSL policies

### 3. Database Security
- [ ] Change default postgres credentials
- [ ] Enable database authentication
- [ ] Set up database connection pooling
- [ ] Configure database backups

## Infrastructure Improvements

### 4. Health Checks
```yaml
# Add to each service
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3001/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

### 5. Logging Strategy
```yaml
# Add to services
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
```

### 6. Resource Management
- [ ] Set memory and CPU limits for ALL services
- [ ] Add resource requests (not just limits)
- [ ] Configure restart policies properly

### 7. Network Security
```yaml
# Add network isolation
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true
```

## Production Environment Setup

### 8. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Separate configs for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Use docker-compose override files
- [ ] Environment-specific resource limits

### 9. Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Configure Grafana dashboards for your apps
- [ ] Set up Prometheus alerting rules
- [ ] Add application-level metrics
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (ELK stack)

### 10. Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Automated database backups
- [ ] Volume backup strategies  
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Test restore procedures

## Operational Readiness

### 11. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Container image scanning
- [ ] Automated deployments
- [ ] Rollback procedures

### 12. Documentation
- [ ] Deployment procedures
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Monitoring runbooks

## Performance & Scalability

### 13. Load Testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Load testing with realistic traffic
- [ ] Database performance tuning
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets

### 14. Auto-scaling (Kubernetes recommended)
- [ ] Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- [ ] Vertical Pod Autoscaler  
- [ ] Cluster autoscaling
- [ ] Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)

## Recommendation: Consider Kubernetes

For production at scale, consider migrating to Kubernetes:
- Better orchestration and scaling
- Built-in service discovery
- Advanced deployment strategies (blue/green, canary)
- Comprehensive ecosystem
- Better secrets management
- Advanced networking policies

## Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level: HIGH** ðŸ”´
- Security vulnerabilities
- No proper secrets management
- Single points of failure
- Limited monitoring

**Target Risk Level: LOW** ðŸŸ¢
- All secrets properly managed
- HTTPS everywhere
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Automated backups
- Tested disaster recovery
