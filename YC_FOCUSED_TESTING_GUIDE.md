- **Progress Visualization**: Live timeline of review stages

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: Common YC-Type Idea (High Rejection Probability)
```json
{
  "title": "AI-Powered Food Delivery Platform",
  "description": "A machine learning platform that optimizes food delivery routes and predicts customer preferences using artificial intelligence."
}
```
**Expected Result**: High chance of rejection (contains keywords: "ai", "machine learning", "food delivery")

#### Test 2: Unique Niche Idea (Low Rejection Probability)
```json
{
  "title": "Underwater Basket Weaving Tutorial Platform",
  "description": "A specialized platform for teaching traditional underwater basket weaving techniques to marine biology students."
}
```
**Expected Result**: Low chance of rejection (no common YC keywords)

#### Test 3: Borderline Case
```json
{
  "title": "Enterprise Email Analytics",
  "description": "Advanced analytics dashboard for enterprise email communications and productivity insights."
}
```
**Expected Result**: Variable result based on similarity calculation

## 🚀 **API Endpoints for Testing**

### Submit Application for Review
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/applications/{id}/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your-jwt-token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Get Real-Time Feedback
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/applications/{id}/feedback \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your-jwt-token}"
```

### Check AI Service Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/ai-review/health
```
